# chatbot-III

Here is a superscript chat bot intergrated into a gitter room.

What you'll need to get started is a Github account for you and your bot.
Sign into [Gitter](https://developer.gitter.im/docs/welcome) as your bot and create a **Personal Access Token**.

With this you can access the Gitter API. You'll need to create a room in Gitter, and add your bot to it.

To set up a config file to run the app you'll need the roomId you want your bot to be active in.

You can hit the Gitter API with the line below replacing `{{token}}` with your **Personal Access Token**

**Get the roomId**

```sh
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer {{token}}" "https://api.gitter.im/v1/rooms"
```

**Get the botId**

```sh
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer {{token}}" "https://api.gitter.im/v1/user"
```

Have a mongodb running. Then start the bot service with

```
npm start
```
